The journey so far in the tech ecosystem has dealt with loads of practice, reading, asking question, hitting a road block and find a thoroughfare. This has been my life on constant repeat. It is boring but I’m super passionate about it. I started my journey in tech 2 year ago, while still undergoing my veterinary medical studies in Uni. It wasn’t easy early on because getting a sense of direction wasn’t easy. The key challenge was knowing what to learn at the right time. This was my dilemma when i got in for the HNG internship at its first edition. I couldn’t keep track because of lack of skills and direction.

My interest has always being automation in software predictions and forcasting which is possible with the help of Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Yeah i said that AI and ML is not all about machines, software can both.

In order for me to get the direction I lacked, I had to start with basic HTML/CSS(Bootstrap) which should be the starting point of developers, but not necessary. I stock with these 2 frontend development skills for a year which was not where and what i wanted to pursue, so in order to get a good understanding the tech landscape in different industries, I had to consume loads of articles and publication from various tech blog. I still do this till date as Medium has played a major role in this, other publications in tech from Wired, Techcrunch, yCombinator, even our local Techpoint as well as Twitter. I learnt quickly that reading was an essential part of development. Don’t just watch tutorial video, READ!, READ! and READ!.

The knowledge from reading has provided me with enough scope to know what I want to learn, what I need to learn and how I can learn. I find this very essential as you would constantly be required to go into new dev areas quickly for more productivity. For me it has been my cheatsheet in the tech landscape.

Don’t get me wrong, I am not Einstein, I am not where I should be yet or where I want to be, but what I know currently is way to valuable and sometimes I can’t comprehend how I got here.

Currently on my HNG Remote Internship journey, we were tasked to design a resume/portfolio page using Figma to design the UI. This is something I have been planning to build for a while. But with this task request, I would definitely put this in work as I have come up with this current design which i may still have to adjust or upgrade.

This is not perfect considering the timing, but I was able to pool this together from my bootstrap experience with a requested format. I had to put into consideration the alignment, colour, spacing, size and numerous design requirement.

Looking to upgrade this as I would be working an Angular design for my official portfolio website. By the way I love Jumbotrons :)

Comment and interactions would surely be appreciated.
